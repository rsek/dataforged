When you first come upon a vault, use the tables on the previous two pages to help envision its form and nature. For a more abstract prompt, just use the Descriptor oracle (page 298). In either case—if that’s enough detail for the role of the vault in your story—stop there.

## Detailed Precursor Vault Generation

If the survey of a vault is a focus for your current quest, use the oracle tables in this section to generate a more complete picture of the site. See the next page for a diagram of the three main phases of exploration.

  * Exterior: Start by generating the basic form and characteristics of the vault using the tables on the previous two pages. These features represent what you observe from a safe distance.
  * Interior: If you enter the site, check the Inner First Look table (page 1)   for initial impressions of what lies within. If you explore further, use the Interior Feature table (page 366) to define what you find or encounter. If you Undertake an Expedition within a vault, check this table if you want help setting the scene for a waypoint.
  * Sanctum: As you delve deeper into a vault, the corruption and strangeness of the place takes hold. Use the Sanctum Feature table (page 368) to represent the aberrant nature of a vault’s depths.

## Delving the Sanctum

Your passage from the Interior into the Sanctum is triggered by a rolled result on the Interior Feature table: “Transition into the Sanctum.”

If you Undertake an Expedition into a vault, you can also use the progress track as a gauge for your current location. Once you reach six or more filled progress boxes, you have reached the Sanctum.

If you envision a vault as particularly strange and perilous, use the Sanctum as the framing for the entirety of your exploration. If it is relatively mundane, use only the Interior.

## Revealing the Vault’s Purpose

If the original function of the vault is a mystery, use the Vault Purpose table (page 365) to see what lies at its heart. Check this oracle when your story leads to a reveal of the site’s true nature, such as when you Finish an Expedition.

## Perils and Opportunities

Use these tables to help envision a complication or favorable circumstance within a vault, such as when you Explore a Waypoint and are prompted to envision a peril or opportunity.
