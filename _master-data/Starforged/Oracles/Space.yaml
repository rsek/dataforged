      Description: |-
        Use the Space Sightings oracle to introduce a location or encounter on a spaceborne expedition. For example, roll on this table when you [Ask the Oracle](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) to envision the primary feature of a waypoint as you [Undertake an Expedition](Starforged/Moves/Exploration/Undertake_an_Expedition). Check your result by referencing the column for your current location: Terminus, Outlands, or Expanse.
