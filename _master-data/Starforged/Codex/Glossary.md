# Glossary

## “Add +X”

Add this value to your action die. For most action rolls, your action die + stat + adds is your final action score. If you gain multiple prompts to “add +x” for a single action, those bonuses stack.

## “Action Score”

When making an action roll, the total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is your action score. The action score is never greater than 10—anything over that is ignored.

## “Allies / Ally”

An ally is a protagonist character controlled by another player.

## “Before Rolling”

Some asset abilities include a benefit at a risk that must be decided prior to rolling the dice. When activating this ability, you must commit to the choice or cost before the dice hit the table.

## “Burn Momentum”

When you have positive momentum, after you make an action roll, you may replace your action score with your current momentum value to improve your result.

Some assets may offer additional benefits when you burn momentum, or will alter the result. But note that you cannot burn momentum unless it actually improves the outcome of the move (making a miss a hit or a weak hit a strong hit).
After you burn momentum, you must reset your momentum.

## “Companion”

A companion is an NPC asset.

## “Companion Takes a Hit (-X)”

Make the Companion Takes a Hit move, suffering the indicated amount of harm to your companion’s health.

## “Choose”

The move will provide a list of options and the number you may select. Unless the move says otherwise, you may not select a single option more than once.

## “Endure Harm (-X)”

Make the Endure Harm move, suffering the indicated amount of harm.

## “Endure Stress (-X)”

Make the Endure Stress move, suffering the indicated amount of stress.

## “Envision”

When you see “envision” as a prompt during gameplay, that’s your reminder to take a moment and put the focus on the fiction by imagining, describing, or discussing what is happening. If you’re unsure, Ask the Oracle, using the Starforged oracles to generate the details of a situation, location, person, creature, and more.

## “In Control” / “In a Bad Spot”

In a fight (using combat moves), your character is in one of two positions: in control or in a bad spot. If you are in control, you can make proactive moves such as Gain Ground and Strike. When in a bad spot, your foes have the upper hand and you must make reactive moves such as React Under Fire and Clash.

When you make a move that doesn’t define whether you are in control or in a bad spot (such as a suffer move), follow these guidelines: On a strong hit, you are in control; on a weak hit or miss, you are in a bad spot.

## “Lose Momentum (-X)”

Make the Lose Momentum move, reducing your momentum meter by the indicated amount.

## “Make a Suffer Move (-X)”

Select a suffer move appropriate to the
situation, and reduce the related condition
meter by the listed amount.

## “Mark [Reward] on Your Quests/Bonds/Discoveries Legacy Track”

Moves and asset abilities may prompt you to mark ticks or fill boxes in one or more of your legacy tracks. This is called a legacy reward. For example, if you Make a Discovery, you and your allies mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

If you are successful as you make a progress move to Fulfill Your Vow, Forge a Bond, or Finish an Expedition, anyone who was part of the shared challenge earns the legacy reward and marks the appropriate legacy track. However, bonus legacy rewards granted by an asset are only for the character making the move, unless the ability specifically provides a reward for allies.

Legacy tracks are not given a rank, but are otherwise treated the same as standard progress tracks. It takes four ticks to fill a box. When you fill a legacy track box, make the Earn Experience move.

## “Mark Progress”

When a move or asset ability prompts you to mark progress, check the rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks in your progress track.

If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a quest, expedition, connection, or fight—you share a progress track. When a move prompts someone to mark progress for that challenge, it is marked on your shared progress track.

## “Mark Progress Twice”

When a move or asset ability prompts you to “mark progress twice,” mark double the number of ticks or boxes per the rank of the challenge. For example, marking progress twice on a troublesome challenge would mean marking 6 boxes (instead of 3). Marking progress twice on a epic challenge would result in 2 ticks (instead of 1).

Any additional instances of “mark progress” gained through an asset ability stack on top of this reward.

## “Match”

A match occurs when you roll the same value on both challenge dice. If a move or ability prompts a specific result for a match, such as “on a match” or “on a strong hit with a match,” act on those instructions. If not, you can use the match as a trigger to introduce a twist or more dramatic outcome.

## “On a Hit” / “If You Score a Hit”

Act on these instructions if you score a weak or strong hit on a move (your action score beats one or both of the challenge dice).

## “On a Miss” / “If You Score a Miss”

Act on these instructions if your action score does not beat (is not greater than) either of the challenge dice. Ties are always in the favor of the challenge dice.

## “On a Strong Hit” / “If You Score a Strong Hit”

Act on these instructions if your action score beats (is greater than) both challenge dice.

## “On a Weak Hit” / “If You Score a Weak Hit”

Act on these instructions if your action score beats (is greater than) one challenge die, but does not beat the other.

## “Pay the Price”

When you suffer a negative outcome on a move, you’ll often see a prompt to Pay the Price. This move helps you resolve the cost of that action. If you’re playing without a guide, you make the most obvious or interesting bad outcome happen based on the current circumstances, roll on the Pay the Price table to see what happens, or Ask the Oracle. If you’re playing with a guide, they can decide what happens, ask you to roll on a table, or talk it through with you.

## “Preset Your Action Die”

Some asset abilities enable you to set your action die to an automatic value instead of rolling that die. If you take that option, roll only the challenge dice and use the preset value to determine your action score.

## “Progress Move”

This is a special type of move to resolve the outcome of a goal or challenge. When you make a progress move, tally the number of filled boxes on your progress track as your progress score. only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal.

You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by negative momentum. In addition, assets abilities do not affect progress rolls unless they define a specific benefit for a progress move.

## “Progress Score”

When making a progress move, tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four ticks) in your progress track for that challenge. This is your progress score, and is used to resolve the move in place of an action score.

## “Reroll”

After you roll your move, you may pick up and reroll the indicated dice. The move or ability will tell you what dice are eligible for the reroll; for example: “reroll your action die,” or “reroll any dice.” Unless stated otherwise, you may not reroll when making a progress move.

You may reroll only once, using a single throw for all dice you are rerolling. The new result for all dice must stand, even if it is a worse outcome than the original roll.

In rare cases, you might have multiple asset abilities that each allow a reroll on the same action. If so, you may make one reroll for every instance of a “reroll” prompt, following the process above.
Unless indicated, a reroll is never required. If you are happy with the first result, let it stand.

## “Reset Momentum”

After you burn momentum, or if prompted to “reset momentum” by a move or asset ability, you must adjust your momentum meter to its reset value.

The default momentum reset is +2, but this value is reduced when you suffer from an impact.

  * If you have one impact marked, your momentum reset is +1.
  * If you have more than one impact marked, your momentum reset is 0.

After you reset your momentum, resolve the move. If the move or an asset provides a momentum bonus as a reward for the move outcome, adjust the meter appropriately.

## “Roll +[Stat/Meter/Other]”

This is the basic action roll. Most action rolls are made by adding the value of a stat to your action die. Moves may indicate a stat you should use, such as “roll +iron.” If it doesn’t, or gives you a choice, use the stat that best fits the situation and your approach.

Some moves and asset abilities will prompt you to use the value of a condition meter instead of a stat (for example, “roll +supply”). Others may include their own custom value or meter in place of a stat.

## “Sacrifice Resources (-X)”

Make the Sacrifice Resources move, suffering the indicated loss of supply.

## “Suffer -X”

Subtract this number from the indicated condition meter. For example, “suffer -1 supply” tells you to reduce your current supply meter value by 1.

## “Take +X”

Add this number to the indicated meter. For example, “take +2 momentum” tells you to add 2 to your current momentum meter. Your assets may offer additional bonuses for a move. Unless stated otherwise, this bonus is added to anything else you gain as a result of the action. If you take +2 momentum as part of a move, and you are aided by an asset that tells you to “take +1 momentum” on the same move, you gain a total of +3 momentum.

## “When You…”

This is a move trigger. When you do this thing, or encounter this situation, make the move.

Moves are player-facing. You or the guide don’t make moves for non-player characters or creatures. If you’re just checking to see if something happens or how someone acts, you can Ask the Oracle.

Asset abilities also use the “when you” trigger to give you additional options and bonuses when making a move. This might be a limited to a specific move (“When you Strike”), or can sometimes apply to any move that fits the scope of a situation (“When you make a move to…”). However, unless an asset specifically defines a benefit for a progress move, you may not leverage an asset ability when making one of those moves.

## “Withstand Damage (-X)”

Make the Withstand Damage move, suffering the indicated amount of damage.
