    description: |-
      Ironlanders are the human inhabitants of these lands. Unless your story emphasizes adventures well outside of the settled regions, the majority of your interactions will be with fellow Ironlanders.

      This section covers a few broad categories of Ironlanders. They are not representative of the variety of people and cultures in these lands. When you are forced to fight an Ironlander and need to determine their rank, you can [Ask the Oracle](ironsworn/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle), or follow these guidelines:

        * A common citizen or brute is **troublesome**.
        * A trained warrior is **dangerous**.
        * A powerful or veteran warrior is **formidable**.

          Another people sailed to the Ironlands from the Old World long before our kin settled here. Something happened. Something changed them.

          Whether it was the long struggle in a harsh land, the ravages of war, or the corruption of some dark force, they left their humanity behind and became what we call the broken. Now, they exist only to kill, to destroy.

          We fear the broken for their savagery. But, more than this, we fear them as a dark portent of what we might one day become.

          A husk is what remains of an [Ironlander](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders) whose body, mind, and soul are hollowed out by dark magic. In their unquenchable thirst for power, they use their own essence to power foul rituals. Bit by bit, they give themselves to this ruinous path. They abandon their kin. They forsake their former lives. Their physical form wastes away. Their mind is shattered.

          In time, only the husk is left. They are a needful thing, tormented by the memory of all they have lost, but willing to lose even more in their quest for power.

          A husk may make tempting offers of rituals or rarities, but be wary. Their bargains are always in their own favor. When they turn against you, a husk is a cunning foe. They weave dreadful spells, summon swarms of lesser creatures, and unleash a savagery inflamed by their anguish.

          Zealots are those we have lost to their faith. Friends and loved ones are discarded or forgotten. Communities are left behind. Possessions are discarded or turned over to the needs of the sect. They live for one purpose, and all other vows are forsaken. This single-minded devotion changes them, sometimes irrevocably.

          Some zealots worship ancient, forgotten gods, and seek to return them to their former horrible glory. Others serve new religious movements, caught up in promises of a better life. Some worship mortal leaders as if they were gods—perhaps even believing them to be the avatar of divinity.

          This sense of belonging, of purpose, can be a powerful lure in this perilous land.

          The primordials, said to be the vestigial spirits of long-forgotten gods, are the most ancient of the [firstborn](ironsworn/encounters/firstborn). Each embodies some aspect of the natural world, bound in a form which is a crude mimicry of a human or large [animal](ironsworn/encounters/animals). A river primordial is a mass of rock, gravel, and flowing water. A forest primordial is comprised of wood, earth, rocks, and plants. A mountain primordial is a lumbering being of glacier stone and ice. A fire primordial, depending on its mood, might take form as embers, ash and smoke—or as a raging pyre.

          They range in size from the height of an [Ironlander](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders) to half-again as tall as a giant. Rumors persist of primordials who dwell in the deepest parts of the [Wilds](ironsworn/encounters/deep_wilds), or high in the ranges of the [Veiled Mountains](ironsworn/regions/veiled_mountains), who are as tall as an ancient tree. Beyond, some suggest, in the Shattered Wastes, live primordials who tower into the clouds. Is the sound of distant thunder sometimes the footfalls of mountain-sized primordials who dwell beyond the edges of the known world?

          Primordials are solitary beings and as unpredictable as the natural forces they personify. They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.

          How do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea. You are just as likely to kill the rain or the sea. A [mystic](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders/mystic) might tell you to use a weapon imbued with elemental power. Don’t trust them. If you see a primordial, keep your distance. Better yet, run.

They are solitary creatures, wary of contact with [Ironlanders](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders) but likely to attack if scared or provoked.

          They move with their back hunched, often skulking on all four gangly limbs. When they stand straight they are much taller than humans—nearly as tall as a giant. Their skin is a sickly pale gray, but they can camouflage themselves by changing it to match their environment.

          Trolls collect objects of all sorts, and particularly value [Ironlander](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders) trinkets. They are tormented by the fear of others stealing their hoard, and are constantly seeking out new, better hiding places. The items are mostly junk to anyone but a troll, but occasionally an object of real value finds its way into the dregs.

          The villagers tolerate the troll who lives nearby because its presence serves to dissuade a greater threat. They even donate items for its hoard, and put up with its occasional thievery. But now, the troll is missing. What is the looming threat the troll helped avert?

      A few notable exceptions—predators, aggressive creatures, and animals trained to fight—are noted here.

          Nightmare spiders are monstrous creatures which dwell in [caves](ironsworn/domains/cavern), [ruins](ironsworn/domains/ruin), [thick woods](ironsworn/domains/tanglewood), and other dark places. They have narrow, translucent bodies, three pairs of black eyes, and long, slender legs. They typically feed on bats and rodents, but are opportunistic hunters and attack anything straying into their path or stumbling into their webbing. Their lairs are often strung with large silk egg sacs.

          For smaller animals, the toxic bite of the nightmare spider causes paralysis. For a typical [Ironlander](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders), it dulls the senses and induces vivid hallucinations. It is these frightening, dreamlike visions which earn the creature its name.

They are not naturally aggressive, but are mighty foes when threatened.

          The color of a gnarl’s bark-like hide changes through its life, emulating the passage of the seasons. A young gnarl’s hide is the verdant green of spring. As they mature, it transitions to the deeper brown-green of summer, then the burnished amber of fall, and finally the cold gray of winter. To protect itself from potential predators, a gnarl will stand among a copse of trees. It will plant its feet, straighten its back, stretch its neck, and stay perfectly still, blending in with its surroundings.

          We don’t know the origin of the Iron Blight, nor do we know its cure. It inflicts creatures of the wilds and transforms their flesh slowly to iron. These pitiful but powerful beasts are scarred by patches of metal flesh within ragged, weeping wounds. The iron is like a parasite, devouring the host as it torments them with unstoppable pain and insatiable hunger. Their howls echo with animalistic agony and the clangor of hammer against anvil.

          In time, the Blight takes too much, and the beast dies while it is still more flesh than iron. We pray a creature never survives beyond that stage. What would it become?

          The kraken is a sea beast, as large as the mightiest longship. It is octopoid in form, with eight arms, two longer feeding tentacles, and a beak-like mouth. It emerges from the depths to hunt whales, sharks, and other large sea creatures. It is also prone to attack any [Ironlander](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders) ships which stray into its waters, plucking the crew off the deck and crushing the vessel as easily as one would snap a piece of kindling.

          A kraken lurks at the mouth of a fjord. Fisher folk refuse to sail those waters, and trade ships rarely survive the passage. The settlement on the fjord cannot survive without resupply, and overland travel is impossible during this harsh winter. Elders tell of the Dawnrunner, a blessed longship of the original settlers, sealed away in a **[Hallowed](ironsworn/themes/hallowed) [Sea Cave](ironsworn/domains/sea_cave)** with the body of its legendary captain. Only this ship, it is said, can outrun the kraken.

          What we call the nightspawn are mutated beasts which take a variety of forms. Some are animal-like, or combine the characteristics of different creatures. Others are bizarre aberrations seemingly born of chaos. A few even possess twisted mockeries of human features.

          They are rare beasts, but dwell in every region and environment of the Ironlands, from the dark waters of the [Ragged Coast](ironsworn/regions/ragged_coast) to the [icy plains](ironsworn/domains/icereach) of the [Shattered Wastes](ironsworn/regions/shattered_wastes). Often, they protect ancient [ruins](ironsworn/domains/ruin), forgotten relics, and other secrets. They watch and wait, and show no mercy to those who trespass in their domain.

          We do not know the origin of the nightspawn. They are enigmatic creatures, rarely emerging from their dark lairs except during the long nights of winter. Is it the latent magic of these lands which gives them life? Have they passed through the veil from some other realm? Perhaps some questions are best left unanswered.

          In the language of the [atanya](ironsworn/encounters/firstborn/atanya), rhaskar means “white death.” This mighty beast dwells within northern waters and amid frozen [icereaches](ironsworn/domains/icereach). It hunts along shorelines, lurks beneath ice, or tracks the frigid wastes in search of prey. Some rhaskar have even been known to attack ships in coastal waters. It is a highly territorial creature, and does not abide trespassers within its domain.

          With its mane of dorsal fur and long, angular head, the rhaskar looks like a fusion of shark and bear—and embodies the strength and cunning of both. It is the uncaring ferocity of these cold northern realms given form.

It seems to act out of a pure compulsion to cause terror and inflict violence rather than any need for food. A [hunter](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders/hunter) tracked it to a **[Wild](ironsworn/themes/wild) [Frozen Cavern](ironsworn/domains/frozen_cavern)**. But they heeded the warning of a pile of bones at the entrance and refused to enter that place.

          Wyrms are massive serpentine creatures. They are kin to the wyverns, but are much larger and wingless. Their lairs are found in [deep caves](ironsworn/domains/cavern), [subterranean vaults](ironsworn/domains/underkeep), or at the heart of [dense forests](ironsworn/domains/tanglewood). They hibernate in those places for weeks or months at a time, waking only to satiate their massive appetites. They are low-slung beasts, with short, thick legs, elongated jaws, and a dense hide.

          A few of those dead do not rest, and rise as bog rots. They are horrible creatures, with preserved flesh stained and withered like old leather. Their eyes are black pits, and their mouths hang open in a perpetual, silent scream.

          It is said a bog rot can only find rest by committing another victim to the mire. A soul for a soul. In those final moments, the creature whispers of ancient secrets and forbidden lore, as if unloading the burden of that dark knowledge.

They are spawned in old battlefields or [tombs](ironsworn/domains/barrow), but often range beyond those places to seek out new victims. At the heart of a horde, surrounded by layers of clattering bones, are the remains of the spiteful being who gives the horror its cruel intelligence.

          Its form varies. In tight spaces, a bonehorde may appear as an amorphous mound or as a spider-like entity with long, skittering limbs.

It dwells in [dark places](ironsworn/domains/cavern) [beneath the earth](ironsworn/domains/underkeep), or in the shadows of [thick woods](ironsworn/domains/tanglewood). At twilight and during the long gray days of winter, it emerges from its lightless refuge to sate its hunger.

Or it will use the cover of darkness to ambush unwary prey. Once enveloped, the victim is a captive audience for the gloom’s apparitions, forced to face their innermost doubts and fears. The gloom picks at their sanity like a scavenger cleaning meat from bones. After a time, there is nothing left but an empty shell.

          A tempest is a fierce, unnatural storm. It can appear in any season or in any weather, but is larger and more powerful in the depths of winter. It is drawn to the warmth of living beings, and seeks to douse that life as one would snuff out a candle.

          A tempest’s true nature is a mystery. Is it intelligent, or just a force of nature? Those who survive an encounter sometimes report hearing hushed voices and seeing strange forms within the whirlwind. Some few tell tales of the eye of the storm, where the colds and wind abate, and where relief from certain death is offered—for a price.
