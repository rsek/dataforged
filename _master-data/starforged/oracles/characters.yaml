      Don’t try to build a fully formed understanding character when you first encounter them; instead, focus on what your character learns or perceives as a first impression using oracles such as [First Look](starforged/oracles/characters/first_look) and [Initial Disposition](starforged/oracles/characters/initial_disposition). Then envision or generate additional details over time.

          Given and family names are presented as a pair, so you may roll once for both or twice to mix-and-match. You can also try reversing given and family names, or use either independently as a standalone name. If you’d like to give a character a callsign, which are the monikers used by spacers, you may roll separately or take the one provided for your rolled name.
