The larva of the telepathic queen can lay dormant for thousands of years, emerging only when its sleep is disturbed by the mental energies of intelligent life. An awoken queen quickly metamorphoses into its adult form and lays its first clutch of eggs. Soon after, newly-hatched drones set out to expand the nest and feed their ravenous progenitor.",

The return of a transport ship ferrying supplies to the researchers is weeks overdue. What is your connection to the facility or to the faction overseeing it?",

These active colossi ignore our attempts at communication and bat away our ineffectual attacks—the technology that powers them is beyond our understanding.",

A few can even sprout multifaceted wings to take to the air. Their lustrous coloration changes to mimic their environment, and they often appear as simply a part of the landscape until an unwitting explorer happens across them.\n\nCrystallids are mineral hoarders. Their hidden burrows hold a cache of precious stones and valuable ores. For this reason, explorers and prospectors often attempt to track crystallids back to their nest. “The bigger the crystallid, the better the haul,” is a common saying among those audacious fortune hunters. But that potential motherlode is not taken without risk—crystallids are fierce protectors of their hoard.",

It is typical of the apex predators that lurk in the unfathomable depths of life-bearing ocean worlds.\n\nTwo wing-like appendages fan out from the back of the flarewing's head. Each is studded with sensory nerves to detect the subtlest of movement, and tipped with bioluminescent lures. When the flarewing closes in on its prey, those wings arch forward to attract and enfold the unfortunate victim. Then, the wide jaws and multi-pronged teeth make short work of the meal.",
    "Quest starter": "In the twilight zone of a tidally-locked watery planet, an underwater mining settlement is the target of an ancient flarewing. In the murk of those dark waters, the beast attacks dive teams, carrier subs, dredging equipment—even undersea platforms. Operations are now stalled, cutting off a key source of unprocessed fuel in the sector. Meanwhile, the settlement's leader, grief-stricken by the loss of someone dear to them, vows to destroy the flarewing. What is your relation to this person? Do you support them in their obsession, or is there a way for the settlers to coexist with this creature?",

Often found in places of great destruction or suffering—battlefields, derelict ships, the ruins of forsaken settlements—the risen protect their place of death fiercely and eternally.\n\nTo say the risen hate the living is untrue; to hate something would require sentience, emotion. Risen are robotic in their duties, automatic in their violence. They wield the weapons they carried in life to better harm their foes, and when that fails, they rake with bony, claw-like fingers. Their garments hang in bloodstained tatters. Their emaciated flesh, stretched taught over their misshapen bones, only hints at the living, breathing human they were before this curse befell them.\n\nMany spacers spin tales of shambling risen encountered on abandoned colony worlds or derelict space cruisers. But perhaps most horrifyingly, it’s said the risen can survive decades in the vacuum of space before latching onto a passing ship or attacking engineers making exterior repairs.",

    "Description": "Void shepherds are benevolent creatures about the size of a snub fighter. They propel themselves through space on trails of vibrant energy, and seem to delight in riding the wake of starships. For spacers navigating the lonely depths of the Forge, they are welcome company and a sign of good fortune.\n\nMany spacers tell stories of being aided by a void shepherd pod. These creatures have an extraordinary intuition, and can escort a wayward spacer back to the right path, guide them away from danger, or lead them toward unseen opportunities.\n\nWhen threatened, shepherds charge and ram with their armored snouts. If this doesn't dissuade their foe, a pod harmonizes their energy output to unleash a burst of electromagnetic force; this attack can daze a creature or knock out a ship's critical systems.",
    "Quest starter": "Several pods of void shepherds shelter within the debris of a shattered world. An expansive mining operation is harvesting the ore-rich rocks of the system, and the shepherds dance playfully in the wake of prospector and transport ships. But an aberrant, predatory creature has made this place its hunting ground, posing a threat to both the shepherd pods and the miners. What is the nature of this creature, and why are you sworn to end its attacks?",

On their homeworld, which was lost a decade ago in a stellar calamity, they used those claws to dig through the arid, rocky ground, and had an unerring knack for finding hidden water sources. Some of the human settlers who fled the doomed planet adopted waterwitchers as companions, and now travel the Forge with their furry friends in tow.\n\nWaterwitchers were a precious part of their ecosystem, and were not preyed upon by other creatures. This made them gentle and trusting to a fault. They often greet potential new friends with enthusiastic sniffing and contented purring.
