Ironsworn/Oracles/Site_Name#Description: Give a site a name or learn more about its characteristics and history.
Ironsworn/Oracles/Site_Name/Description#Description: |-
  Even without giving a site a name, you can use the Description and Detail oracles to help flesh out the theme and nature of that place.

  For example, you hear rumors about a nearby ruin while visiting a settlement. What do you learn? You Ask the Oracle, using the Description and Detail tables. The oracle responds, “Bloodied Banishment.”

  Interpreting these keywords, you envision this settlement’s grim method of enacting justice. Anyone sentenced to death for a crime is taken to the ruins. There, under the fading light of the setting sun, they are bloodied by the quick slash of a ceremonial blade. Finally, they are chained to an altar within the central courtyard. The foul creatures who dwell in that place do the rest.

Ironsworn/Oracles/Site_Name/Format#Description: |-
  To generate a name for a site, first roll on the Format table above. Then, fill in the blanks by using the [Description](Ironsworn/Oracles/Site_Name/Description), [Detail](Ironsworn/Oracles/Site_Name/Detail), [Namesake](Ironsworn/Oracles/Site_Name/Namesake), and [Place](Ironsworn/Oracles/Site_Name/Place) oracles.

  If the form of a particular word doesn’t work, try making it plural instead of singular, or vice-versa.

  If you already know the theme and domain, you can pick from the tables instead of rolling. If not, you can use these oracles to help define those aspects of the site. Use the Place oracle to roll for a domain, and let the Description and Detail oracles inform your selection of a theme.

  The site’s name might be known in your world, or it could just be an evocative label you use to understand its history and nature.
