        Use these oracles to generate the details of a location, discovery, or encounter. The Descriptor oracle is particularly handy for quick generation of a location. For example, use it to describe the basic nature of a planet instead of rolling on the detailed planet oracles.

        Descriptor and Focus can answer questions such as:
          * What is this ship’s cargo?
          * What is the nature of this planet?
          * What is inside this station?
