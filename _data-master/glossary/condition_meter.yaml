      **Health** represents your current physical condition and stamina, ranked from 0 to +5. Health is reduced when you [Endure Harm](#Endure-Harm), and increased when you rest or receive care through moves such as [Heal](#Heal).

      If you are at 0 health, scoring a miss when you [Endure Harm](#Endure-Harm) puts you at risk of suffering an impact (page 46) or dying.
  - Name: Spirit
    Description: |-
      **Spirit** is your current morale and mental state, ranked from 0 to +5. Spirit is reduced when you [Endure Stress](#Endure-Stress). It is increased when you find comfort in companionship or relaxed moments through moves such as [Hearten](#Hearten).

      If you are at 0 spirit, scoring a miss when you [Endure Stress](#Endure-Stress) puts you at risk of suffering an impact or falling into desolation.
  - Name: Supply
    Description: |-
      **Supply** is an abstract representation of your preparedness, including food, water, fuel, ammo, equipment, cargo, money, and general upkeep.

      Supply is ranked from 0 to +5. It is decreased when you make the [Sacrifice Resources](#Sacrifice-Resources) move, and is increased when you [Resupply](#Resupply) to fortify your provisions and readiness.

      If you need to know if you have a specific item or resource at hand, make the [Check Your Gear](#Check-Your-Gear) move. When you [Sacrifice Resources](#Sacrifice-Resources) and your supply falls to 0, you must mark unprepared (page 46).

      #### Supply and Allies

      If you are playing with others, the supply meter represents the shared resources among your party. You and your allies use the same supply value while you travel together. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer the result of an outcome that forces you to [Sacrifice Resources](#Sacrifice-Resources), each of you adjust your supply meter accordingly. If anyone must mark unprepared, everyone marks unprepared.
  - Name: Asset condition meters
    Description: |-
      Several assets have their own condition meters.

        * Your STARSHIP and other vehicles have an **integrity meter** (seen here at the bottom of this asset card) to measure their condition. When your vehicle faces a damaging situation, make the [Withstand Damage](#Withstand-Damage) move. To get a vehicle back up to speed, make the [Repair](#Repair) move.
        * Companion assets have a **health meter**, which is reduced when you make the [Companion Takes a Hit](#Companion-Takes-a-Hit) move. Their health is increased through the [Heal](#Heal) move when you treat them or obtain treatment—or using the [Repair](#Repair) move for mechanical companions.
        * Some assets have a unique condition meter for a specialized resource. For example, if you are a FIREBRAND, you have a fire meter and tap into that inner source to unleash destructive energies.

      To track the value of a condition meter on an asset card, use a paperclip or token. Or you can set a six-sided die on top of the card and rotate it to show the current value. The value of a meter cannot exceed the maximum shown on the card.

      You can learn more about assets starting on page 50.
