  - Name: The Terminus
    Description: |-
      Your people landed in this region following their exodus from their home galaxy. Settlements are common here. Factions compete for resources, and spaceborne caravans follow charted paths among the stars. But the Forge is a vast galaxy; even here, there are still unknown and isolated domains.
  - Name: The Outlands
    Description: |-
      In the last few decades, your people have pushed deeper into the galaxy, searching for habitable planets, resources, and opportunities. Settlements within the Outlands are scattered, and navigation paths are often uncharted.
  - Name: The Expanse
    Description: |-
      A few bold pioneers have delved the far-flung reaches of the Forge. Isolated settlements have been built among these distant domains, but they are usually lost and disconnected from the settled regions.
  - Name: The Void
    Description: |-
      Beyond the Forge, there are only a few isolated stars and vast gulfs of nothing. Travel beyond the periphery of the Forge is difficult or impossible.
