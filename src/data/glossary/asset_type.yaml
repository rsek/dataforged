  - Name: Command Vehicle
    Color: "#9aa3ad"
    Description: |-
      The **command vehicle** is your interstellar STARSHIP. It is a default asset for your character, taken when you begin your campaign. If you are playing with others, this is a shared asset; each of you may use the STARSHIP's abilities while aboard the craft.

      The command vehicle has an integrity meter and starts at +5 integrity. When your STARSHIP takes a hit, make the [Withstand Damage](Moves#Withstand-Damage) move to see what happens.
  - Name: Module
    Color: "#7f5a90"
    Description: |-
      **Modules** are attached to your STARSHIP, and offer additional options and advantages when aboard that vehicle.

      As with the ship itself, these can benefit any ally. However, modules are acquired and managed by a single character.

      When you [Withstand Damage](Moves#Withstand-Damage) and score a miss, you can mark a module as **broken** to offset potential danger to your command vehicle. A broken module cannot be used until you successfully [Repair](Moves#Repair) it.
  - Name: Support Vehicle
    Color: "#495790"
    Description: |-
      **Support vehicles** complement your command vehicle for planetside or short-range operations. If you are playing with others, one of you might serve as the pilot or owner of a support vehicle, but anyone on board can use its abilities as appropriate to the situation.

      As with the command vehicle, your support vehicles have integrity meters. The maximum integrity varies based on the type of vehicle. When a support vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment, you must [Withstand Damage](Moves#Withstand-Damage) to see how it fares.
  - Name: Path
    Color: "#3f7faa"
    Description: |-
      **Paths** are your background, interests, training, skills, powers, and key equipment. They provide mechanical and narrative advantages, but also reflect who you are and how you interact with the world. When you create your character in the next chapter, you'll select at least two paths to get started.

      Some paths represent your skill with a signature weapon style or piece of equipment. If you see a requirement at the top of the asset card, such as "If you wield a bladed weapon...," the asset is not usable without that item.
  - Name: Companion
    Color: "#3d8b8a"
    Description: |-
      **Companions** are NPC helpers. When you gain a companion, give them a name and envision their appearance and personality.

      Companions utilize a health meter which can be reduced if an outcome puts them in harm's way. When your companion faces harm, make the [Companion Takes a Hit](Moves#Companion-Takes-a-Hit) move. When their health is at 0, they are in danger of being killed or destroyed.
  - Name: Deed
    Color: "#40834f"
    Description: |-
      **Deeds** represent the notable achievement and situations of your story, and how those events change your character.

      Deeds have a requirement listed at the top of the card, phrased as "Once you [blank]." You may not spend experience to acquire a deed until you fulfill the requirement.
