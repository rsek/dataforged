Upgrading a companion enables additional abilities.\n\nCompanions utilize a health track and may suffer harm as a result of one of your moves. When your companion takes damage, make the [Companion Endure Harm](Ironsworn/Moves/Suffer/Companion_Endure_Harm) move (page 94) to determine the outcome. See page 43 to learn more.",

      "Description": "*Ironsworn* characters are assumed to be skilled fighters. Even without a combat talent, you can wield weapons and perform combat moves (page 78). A combat talent reflects a particular area of expertise, and gives you additional options and bonuses.\n\nCombat talent assets typically require you to wield a specific weapon, as noted in the asset text. For example, if you are a **Shield-Bearer** and don’t have a shield at the ready, you can’t use the asset’s abilities.",

They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.\n\nHow do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea.

It is a highly territorial creature, and does not abide trespassers within its domain.\n\nWith its mane of dorsal fur and long, angular head, the rhaskar looks like a fusion of shark and bear—and embodies the strength and cunning of both. It is the uncaring ferocity of these cold northern realms given form.",

They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.\n\nThere are three key aspects of using the fate moves:\n  * **Instinct:** If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.\n  * **Randomness:** You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.\n  * **Inspiration:** You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the oracles chapter (page 165) to guide your story.",

Combined, the Action and Theme tables provide creative prompts suitable for most situations and questions. In fact, with some creative interpretations, it’s entirely possible to play with only these two tables.",
