      *Ironsworn* characters are assumed to be skilled fighters. Even without a combat talent, you can wield weapons and perform [combat moves](id:classic/collections/moves/combat). A combat talent reflects a particular area of expertise, and gives you additional options and bonuses.

      Combat talent assets typically require you to wield a specific weapon, as noted in the asset text. For example, if you are a **Shield-Bearer** and don’t have a shield at the ready, you can’t use the asset’s abilities.
