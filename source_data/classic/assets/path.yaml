    summary: Paths represent your background, interests, training, and skills.
    description: |-
      Paths represent your background, interests, training, and skills. They provide mechanical and narrative advantages, but also reflect who you are and how you interact with the world. For example, a [Ritualist](id:classic/assets/path/ritualist) would likely have a different outlook than a [Veteran](id:classic/assets/path/veteran). Choosing both those paths can reflect an evolution of your character or an interesting background.

              When you create an elixir, choose an effect: Deftness (edge), audacity (heart), vigor (iron), slyness (shadow), or clarity (wits). Then, suffer -1 supply and roll +wits. On a strong hit, you create a single dose. The character who consumes the elixir must [Face Danger](id:classic/moves/adventure/face_danger) +iron and score a hit, after which they add +1 when making moves with the related stat until their health, spirit, or momentum fall below +1. On a weak hit, as above, but suffer an additional -1 supply to create it.
