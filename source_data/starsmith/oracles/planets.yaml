            result: Desert World
            summary: An arid land devoid of most life stretches around the globe. If there is any vegetation, it is sparse at best as few plants can survive the choking sandstorms. Rocky sea beds now filled with sand hint that water once covered large areas of the surface centuries or millennia ago. The utter desolation is forbidding.

            result: Furnace World
            summary: Volcanic ruptures dot the surface of this planet allowing lava, ash and gas to escape from magma chambers deep within the core. The sheer volume of fiery lava casts an eerie red glow onto anything in orbit. Steam swirls through the Atmosphere creating massive weather systems.

            result: Grave World
            summary: This world was once home to a robust civilization but is now nothing more than a desiccated husk. Ruins, battlefields, and disconcerting silence cover the surface. Did anyone make it off-world before the end?

            result: Ice World
            summary: A world blanketed in snow, winter has come and never leaves. Vast tundras sprawl across the surface while continent-sized glaciers carve out whole mountain ranges. Even from orbit it is difficult to tell whether one area is a landmass or just a large snowstorm. Parts of the ocean flash froze leaving waves of ice behind.

            result: Jovian World
            summary: Dense gases make up discernible and colorful layers on the way down to this planet’s tiny core of dense rock and magma. Storms perpetually rage in the Atmosphere with constant winds blowing at hurricane force or greater. It is said that some individual storms have lasted for centuries.

            result: Jungle World
            summary: Dense forests and tangled vegetation cover more primeval growth from millennia past all over the surface of this planet. Life here is savage and fierce, fighting to thrive and not just survive. What secrets the rain-soaked canopy hides is anyone’s guess, but the diversity of life here suggests there will indeed be secrets.

            result: Ocean World
            summary: 'Ocean worlds may be an endless sea of water, but some are made up of other thalassogen such as ammonia, lava, or hydrocarbons. Other ocean worlds have their worlds contained between two icy spheres: a top layer protecting the water from solar radiation and a lower layer protecting the water from the planet’s core.'

            result: Rocky World
            summary: All rocky planets have a metallic core , but the type of rock that dominates on their surface can be silicon-based or carbon-based. Either type of surface can be hostile to life and treacherous to traverse. These planets may be a source of minerals, but the environment is unforgiving.

            max: 92
            result: Shattered World
            summary: Destructive forces have torn this world to pieces. Chunks of earth and debris orbit around larger sections of the remaining partial planet. The planetary core is no longer in tact and bleeds out into space. What caused this destruction is unknown, but if it is still around, it is surely dangerous.
          - min: 93
            max: 98
            result: Tainted World
            summary: 'The evolution of life itself is responsible for the death of this planet. Whether a civilization greedily consumed the planetary resources thereby polluting the world or a dangerous micro-organism proliferated rapidly, the result is the same: a planet of death.'
          - min: 99
            max: 100
            result: Vital World
            summary: Against all odds, life finds a way. Even in the emptiness of space, tiny pockets of hope can be found, and this planet offers that. Liquid water exists here which has given a chance for both flora and fauna to flourish. If you can’t find exactly what you need here, you can at least find a moment of respite.
