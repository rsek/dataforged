              You gain a specialist. The specialist is part of your crew, but is tracked as a connection and provides benefits to you and your allies per their role. When you [Withstand Damage](id:sundered_isles/moves/suffer/withstand_damage) and score a miss, or if you [Pay the Price](id:sundered_isles/moves/fate/pay_the_price), you may suffer the cost by noting the specialist as out of action. An out of action specialist provides no benefit. To restore a specialist to duty, resolve the situation as appropriate to the nature of the injury, trauma, or dispute.
          - text: |-
              Gain additional specialists by spending 1 experience to add a connection to your crew as a specialist. Specialist bonuses may not be stacked for a single action.

              When you [Secure an Advantage](id:sundered_isles/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) by gathering your specialists to strategize or problem-solve, you may reroll one die for each participating specialist.

              You are cursed and remade by your encounter with death or desolation. Discard two or more assets connected to your former nature, and take up to three assets to represent your damned existence. Give the new assets a special mark. When you [Advance](id:sundered_isles/moves/legacy/advance) and upgrade a damned asset, spend 1 experience (instead of 2).
          - text: |-
              Choose a community where you are accepted in spite of (or because of) your cursed nature. When you [Sojourn](id:sundered_isles/moves/recover/sojourn) there, reroll any dice.
          - text: |-
              When your curse is broken through the fulfillment of a vow or other event, activate this ability at no cost. Discard this asset and any of your damned assets, exchanging them one-for-one for new assets with an equal number of marked abilities. You may then improve one of your stats by +1.

              Your fleet has a starting and max power of 4. When you make a move as a fleetwide action to get in position, avoid a hazard, or fight, roll +power. If you [Pay the Price](id:sundered_isles/moves/fate/pay_the_price) and your fleet bears the cost, suffer -1 power. At 0 power, mark the fleet as wrecked. To refit the fleet, [Sojourn](id:sundered_isles/moves/recover/sojourn) and forgo an automatic strong hit on a recover move to take +2 power; if the fleet is wrecked, first spend 2 experience to clear that status.
          - text: |-
              Take +2 power and set your max power to 5.

              This is not your end. Envision your undead form and nature. This asset counts as a permanent impact, but you are now resistant to mortal harm. When you [Endure Harm](id:sundered_isles/moves/suffer/endure_harm), you may first [Lose Momentum](id:sundered_isles/moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-1, -2, or -3) to offset an equal amount of harm. If potential harm remains, and you choose to resist the harm, roll +spirit.

              You may move at-will between the mortal world and the realm of the dead, can take others with you, and may navigate those paths to bypass or hasten a mortal journey. When you [Undertake an Expedition](id:sundered_isles/moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition) within the realms of the dead, roll +spirit. On a strong hit, mark progress.
