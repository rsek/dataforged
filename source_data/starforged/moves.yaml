      **Session moves** provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions.
    description: |-
      The __session moves__ fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.

      Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

          **When you begin a significant session or chapter of play**, do all of the following.

            * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](id:starforged/moves/session/set_a_flag).
            * Review or recap what happened last session.
            * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

          In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

          **When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the game for your comfort or enjoyment**, pause and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.

            * **Reframe:** This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
            * **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
            * **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
            * **Redirect:** Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
            * **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

      The __adventure moves__ encompass broadly useful actions to overcome obstacles, reinforce your position, conduct investigations, influence others, and support your fellow protagonists. When you face a peril or try to gain leverage, and another move does not apply, you'll likely find your answer among these moves.

    summary: Make these __quest moves__ when you swear vows, make progress on your quests, and resolve vows.
    description: |-
      In the fiction of the *Starforged* setting, those who swear vows are the Ironsworn, and their promises are binding. Vows can be made to yourself, as a solemn representation of your personal commitment, or as a promise to someone else. Some vows might be made grudgingly—out of duty, necessity, or tradition. Others will be made with your whole heart.

            * Return to the expedition: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the expedition's rank by one (if not already epic).

          **When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, or succumb to death or desolation**, you may create a new character in your established setting. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare to each of the former character's legacy tracks: quests, bonds, and discoveries (one roll per track).

          For each __strong hit__, choose one from below, or one from the weak hit or miss options.

            * Follow their path: Take one path or companion asset from the former character (at no cost), including any marked abilities.
            * Share a connection: Take one connection from the former character, including any accrued progress or bond benefits.
            * Accept an inheritance: Take the former character's command vehicle and one module or support vehicle (at no cost), including any marked abilities.

          For each __weak hit__, choose one from below, or one from the miss options.

            * See it through: Choose one of the former character's unfinished quests, and [Swear an Iron Vow](id:starforged/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) (with an automatic strong hit) to see it done. You may immediately mark up to half their earned progress (round down) on this quest.
            * Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character's connections, and envision how time or circumstances have changed them in a dramatic way. When you [Make a Connection](id:starforged/moves/connection/make_a_connection) with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark two ticks on your bonds legacy track.
            * Explore familiar ground: Name a location that was meaningful to the former character. When you first visit that place, envision how it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

          For each __miss__, choose one.

            * Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former character's foes has gained power or influence.
            * Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your former character's beliefs, goals, or allegiances.
            * Open Pandora's Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.
