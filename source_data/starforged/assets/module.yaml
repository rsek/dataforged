    # Summary: Enhanced features or capabilities of your STARSHIP. As with the ship itself, these are shared assets; a module’s abilities can benefit other player characters if it’s reasonable for them to make use of it.
    description: |-
      **Modules** are linked to your STARSHIP and offer additional options and advantages when aboard that vehicle.

      These assets are earned and managed by a single character. They can be shared with allies, but only if it's practical for them to make use of it (not everyone may know how to use a RESEARCH LAB).

      When you [Withstand Damage](id:starforged/moves/suffer/withstand_damage) and score a miss, you can mark a module as broken to offset further danger for your STARSHIP. Flip the card over to indicate its broken state. A broken module cannot be used until you successfully [Repair](id:starforged/moves/recover/repair) it.
