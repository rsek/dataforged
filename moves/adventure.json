Take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, you succeed, but at a troublesome cost. Make a suffer move (-1).\n\nOn a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. __Pay the Price__."

      "Text": "**When you search for clues, ask questions, analyze evidence, or do research**, roll +wits.\n\nOn a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **miss**, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. __Pay the Price__."

If you...\n\n  * Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart\n  * Threaten or incite: Roll +iron\n  * Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow\n\nOn a **strong hit**, they’ll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer.\n\nOn a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand which costs you greatly. __Pay the Price__."

Take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, you have it, but must choose one.\n\n  * Your supply is diminished: __Sacrifice Resources__ (-1)\n  * It’s not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: __Lose Momentum__ (-2)\n\nOn a **miss**, you don’t have it and the situation grows more perilous. __Pay the Price__."
