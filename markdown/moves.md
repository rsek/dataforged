# Starforged Moves

## Session Moves

The **session moves** fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.

Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

### Begin a Session

**When you begin a significant session or chapter of play**, do all of the following.

  * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](Starforged/Moves/Session/Set_a_Flag).
  * Review or recap what happened last session.
  * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

Roll   | Result
-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1-10   | Flashback reveals an aspect of your background or nature
11-20  | Flashback reveals an aspect of another character, place, or faction
21-30  | Influential character or faction is introduced or given new detail
31-40  | Seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected
41-50  | External factors create new danger, urgency, or importance for a quest
51-60  | Important character is put in danger or suffers a misadventure
61-70  | Key location is made unsafe or becomes mired in conflict
71-80  | Unexpected return of an enemy or threat
81-90  | Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view
91-100 | Unforeseen aid is on the way or within reach

### Set a Flag

**When you identify situations or topics you don’t want to include, don’t want to envision in detail, or otherwise may need mindfulness when approaching**, that content is now flagged.

When you encounter content flagged as something to approach mindfully, pause to consider or discuss its role in your story. When you come across flagged content that you would rather adjust or omit, [Change Your Fate](Starforged/Moves/Session/Change_Your_Fate).

### Change Your Fate

**When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the game for your comfort or enjoyment**, pause and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.

  * **Reframe:** This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
  * **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
  * **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
  * **Redirect:** Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
  * **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

### Take a Break

**When you resolve a progress move or complete an intense scenario**, take a few deep breaths and take some time to attend to the needs of your body. Reflect on what just happened and how it made you feel. Then, choose one.

  * Move on: Continue the session. You or an ally may add +1 on the next move (not a progress move), bolstered by your reflection and past experiences.
  * Stop for now: [End a Session](Starforged/Moves/Session/End_a_Session).

### End a Session

**When you end a significant session or chapter of play**, reflect on the events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark progress.

  * If you strengthened your ties to a connection, [Develop Your Relationship](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Develop_Your_Relationship).
  * If you moved forward on a quest, [Reach a Milestone](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Reach_a_Milestone).

If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to give focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.

## Adventure Moves

The **adventure moves** encompass broadly useful actions to overcome obstacles, reinforce your position, conduct investigations, influence others, and support your fellow protagonists. When you face a peril or try to gain leverage, and another move does not apply, you'll likely find your answer among these moves.

### Face Danger

**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without a cost. Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-1).

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Secure an Advantage

**When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **hit**, you succeed. On a **strong hit**, take both. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Take +2 momentum
  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Gather Information

**When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze evidence, or do research**, roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1 momentum.

On a **miss**, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Compel

**When you try to persuade someone or make them an offer**, envision your approach. If you...

  * Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart
  * Threaten or incite: Roll +iron
  * Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow

On a **strong hit**, they'll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer.

On a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand that costs you greatly. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Aid Your Ally

**When you act in direct support of an ally**, envision how you aid them. Then, [Secure an Advantage](Starforged/Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage) or [Gain Ground](Starforged/Moves/Combat/Gain_Ground) to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you [Gain Ground](Starforged/Moves/Combat/Gain_Ground) and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a **weak hit**, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.

### Check Your Gear

**When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you have it, but must choose one.

  * Your supply is diminished: [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) (-1)
  * It's not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2)

On a **miss**, you don't have it and the situation grows more perilous. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Quest Moves

In the fiction of the *Starforged* setting, those who swear vows are the Ironsworn, and their promises are binding. Vows can be made to yourself, as a solemn representation of your personal commitment, or as a promise to someone else. Some vows might be made grudgingly—out of duty, necessity, or tradition. Others will be made with your whole heart.

Make these **quest moves** when you swear vows, make progress on your quests, and resolve vows.

### Swear an Iron Vow

**When you swear upon iron to complete a quest**, write your vow and give it a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a connection, add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.

On a **strong hit**, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next. Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you are determined but begin your quest with more questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to find a path forward.

On a **miss**, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way.

### Reach a Milestone

**When you make headway in your quest** by doing any of the following...

  * overcoming a critical obstacle
  * gaining meaningful insight
  * completing a perilous expedition
  * acquiring a crucial item or resource
  * earning vital support
  * defeating a notable foe

...you may mark progress per the rank of the vow.

### Fulfill Your Vow

*Progress Move*

**When you reach the end of your quest**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, your vow is fulfilled. Mark a reward on your quests legacy track per the vow's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this vow also mark the reward.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. If you [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to set things right, take your full legacy reward. Otherwise, make the reward one rank lower.

On a **miss**, your vow is undone through an unexpected complication or realization. Envision what happens and choose one.

  * Give up on the quest: [Forsake Your Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Forsake_Your_Vow).
  * Recommit to the quest: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the vow's rank by one (if not already epic).

### Forsake Your Vow

**When you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is lost to you**, clear the vow.

Then, envision the impact of this failure and choose one or more as appropriate to the nature of the vow. Any allies who shared this vow may also envision a cost.

  * You are demoralized or dispirited: [Endure Stress](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Stress).
  * A connection loses faith: [Test Your Relationship](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Test_Your_Relationship) when you next interact.
  * You must abandon a path or resource: Discard an asset.
  * Someone else pays a price: Envision how a person, being, or community bears the cost of the failure.
  * Someone else takes advantage: Envision how an enemy gains power.
  * Your reputation suffers: Envision how this failure marks you.

## Connection Moves

**Connections** are NPCs (non-player characters) who represent a deep, vital, or interesting relationship in your story. They are your tethers to the people and places of the Forge.

Make these **connection moves** when you introduce connections and as you build influence or understanding with them.

### Make a Connection

**When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion)**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.

On a **miss**, you don't make a connection and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Develop Your Relationship

**When you reinforce your relationship with a connection** by doing any of the following...

  * swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
  * completing a quest to their benefit
  * leveraging their help in desperate circumstances
  * giving them something of worth
  * sharing a profound moment
  * standing with them against hardship
  * overcoming a test of your relationship

...you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.

If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark progress. Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your legacy: troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4; epic=+5. On a **strong hit**, mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track. On a **strong hit with a match**, you may also envision how recent events bolstered your connection’s standing and raise their rank by one (if not already epic). On a **weak hit**, take +2 momentum. On a **miss**, take no lasting benefit.

### Test Your Relationship

**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Develop_Your_Relationship).

On a **weak hit**, [Develop Your Relationship](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Develop_Your_Relationship), but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.

  * Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
  * Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail the quest, the connection is permanently undone.

### Forge a Bond

*Progress Move*

**When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you now share a bond. Mark a reward on your bonds legacy track per the connection's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who share this connection also mark the reward. Then, choose one.

  * Bolster their influence: When they aid you on a move closely associated with their role, add +2 instead of +1.
  * Expand their influence: Give them a second role. When they aid you on a move closely associated with either role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but they ask something more of you first. To gain the bond and the legacy reward, envision the nature of the request, and do it (or [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to see it done).

On a **miss**, they reveal a motivation or background that puts you at odds. If you recommit to this relationship, roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the connection's rank by one (if not already epic).

## Exploration Moves

The Forge is a vast, chaotic, and largely unexplored galaxy. Your sworn vows will take you through uncharted space, across the surface of inhospitable planets, and into the depths of foreboding derelicts, enigmatic alien vaults, and other perilous sites.

Will you survive these expeditions? What will they cost you? What wonders and horrors will you face? Use the **exploration moves** to find out.

### Undertake an Expedition

**When you trailblaze a route through perilous space, journey over hazardous terrain, or survey a mysterious site**, give the expedition a name and rank. Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If you...

  * Move at speed: Roll +edge
  * Keep under the radar: Roll +shadow
  * Stay vigilant: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark progress per the rank of the expedition.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.

### Make a Discovery

**When your exploration of a waypoint uncovers something wondrous**, roll on the table below or choose one. Then, envision the nature of the discovery and how it is revealed. When you first experience or engage with the discovery, you and your allies may mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

## Combat Moves

The Forge is a perilous galaxy. Factions fight for control. Pirates hunt the spaceways. Raiders prey on vulnerable settlements. Dangerous creatures and chaotic terrors stalk the unwary. Dreaded foes and powerful forces will oppose your sworn quests. Eventually, you'll be forced to fight.

When you face one or more foes in high-stakes, action-oriented conflict, use the **combat moves**. These moves encompass on-foot action and vehicle sorties—or both as part of the same challenge.

### Enter the Fray

  * In the thick of it at close quarters: Roll +iron

On a **miss**, your foe gains the upper hand, the fight moves to a new location, or you encounter a new peril. You are in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### React Under Fire

On a **miss**, your foe dominates this exchange. You stay in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Take Decisive Action

*Progress Move*

**When you seize an objective in a fight**, envision how you take decisive action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak hit as a miss.

On a **strong hit**, you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives remain and the fight continues, you are in control.

On a **weak hit**, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.

When you bear the brunt of a failed action or make a concession, the suffer moves help resolve the cost. These moves are typically made when you must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price) and face a hardship that directly impacts your well-being and readiness, or as prompted by a move or asset.

### Lose Momentum

**When you are delayed or disadvantaged**, suffer -1 momentum for a minor setback, -2 for a serious setback, or -3 for a major setback.

When your momentum is at its minimum (-6) and you must suffer -momentum, choose one.

  * Envision how the price is paid and apply the cost to a different suffer move.
  * Envision how this undermines your progress on a vow, expedition, connection, or combat. Then, clear 1 unit of progress on that track per its rank: troublesome=3 boxes; dangerous=2 boxes; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 ticks; epic=1 tick.

### Endure Harm

**When you face physical injury, fatigue, or illness**, suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your health is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if your health is 0 or you choose to resist the harm, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health
  * Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not wounded, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 health. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 health or [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your health is 0, you must also mark wounded or permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.

Roll   | Result
-------|---------
1-10   | You suffer mortal harm. [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
11-20  | You are dying. Within an hour or two, you must [Heal](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Heal) and raise your health above 0, or [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
21-35  | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to ongoing harm, [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
36-50  | You are reeling. If you engage in any vigorous activity before taking a breather, roll on this table again (before resolving the other move).
51-100 | You are still standing.

### Endure Stress

**When you face mental strain, shock, or despair**, suffer -1 spirit for minor stress, -2 for serious stress, or -3 for major stress. If your spirit is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining stress.

Then, if your spirit is 0 or you choose to resist the stress, roll +spirit or +heart, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Shake it off: If you are not shaken, take +1 spirit
  * Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not shaken, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 spirit. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it's worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 spirit or [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your spirit is 0, you must also mark shaken or traumatized, or roll on the table below.

Roll   | Result
-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-10   | You are overwhelmed. [Face Desolation](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Desolation).
11-25  | You give up. [Forsake Your Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Forsake_Your_Vow).
26-50  | You give in to fear or compulsion, and act against your better instincts.
51-100 | You persevere.

### Companion Takes a Hit

**When your companion faces physical hardship**, they suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your companion's health is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if their health is 0 or you choose to test their resilience, roll +your companion's health.

On a **strong hit**, your companion rallies. Give them +1 health.

On a **weak hit**, if your companion's health is not 0, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) and give them +1 health. Otherwise, they press on.

On a **miss**, it's worse than you thought. They suffer an additional -1 health or you [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your companion's health is 0, they are out of action until given aid. If their health is 0 and you rolled a miss with a match on this move, they are dead or destroyed; discard the asset.

### Sacrifice Resources

**When you lose or consume resources**, suffer -1 supply for a minor loss, -2 for a serious loss, or -3 for a major loss.

If your supply is exhausted (reduced to 0), mark **unprepared**. When you suffer a loss of resources while unprepared, envision how this causes you hardship and apply the cost to a different suffer move.

### Withstand Damage

**When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment**, suffer -1 integrity for minor damage, -2 for serious damage, or -3 for major damage. If your integrity is 0, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining damage.

Then, if your integrity is 0 or you choose to resist the damage, roll +integrity.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Bypass: If your vehicle is not battered, take +1 integrity
  * Ride it out: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if your vehicle is not battered, you may [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 integrity. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 integrity or [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your integrity is 0, also suffer a cost according to the vehicle type.

  * **Command vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or **cursed**, mark a module as **broken**, destroy a broken module by discarding it, or roll on the table below. If the command vehicle is destroyed, [Overcome Destruction](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Overcome_Destruction).
  * **Support vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or roll on the table below. If the vehicle is destroyed, discard the asset.
  * **Incidental vehicle:** Roll on the table below.

Roll   | Result
-------|-------------------
1-10   | Immediate catastrophic destruction. All aboard must [Endure Harm](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm) or [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death), as appropriate.
11-25  | Destruction is imminent and unavoidable. If you do not have the means or intention to get clear, [Endure Harm](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm) or [Face Death](Starforged/Moves/Threshold/Face_Death), as appropriate.
26-40  | Destruction is imminent, but can be averted if you [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair) your vehicle and raise its integrity above 0. If you fail, see 11-25.
41-55  | You cannot [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair) this vehicle until you [Resupply](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Resupply) and obtain a crucial replacement part. If you roll this result again prior to that, see 11-25.
56-70  | The vehicle is crippled or out of your control. To get it back in action, you must [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair) and raise its integrity above 0.
71-85  | It’s a rough ride. All aboard must make the [Endure Harm](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm), [Endure Stress](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Stress), or [Companion Takes a Hit](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Companion_Takes_a_Hit) move, suffering a serious (-2) cost.
86-95  | You’ve lost fuel, energy, or cargo. [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) (-2).
96-100 | Against all odds, the vehicle holds together.

## Recover Moves

Life as an Ironsworn is not easy or comfortable. When your resources are strained, your health and spirit ebbing, your equipment and vehicles in disrepair, you'll need to find relief from the perils of the Forge and the burdens of your sworn oaths.

Make these **recover moves** when you attempt to rest, recover, or refit.

### Sojourn

**When you spend time recovering within a community**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, this is a safe refuge. You and your allies may each choose two recover moves: [Heal](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Heal), [Hearten](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Hearten), [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair), or [Resupply](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Resupply). Instead of rolling, assume an automatic strong hit for each. An individual move can be taken more than once.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but time is short or resources are strained. You and your allies each make one recover move instead of two, with no more than three moves total among the group.

On a **miss**, choose one.

  * The community needs your help, or makes a costly demand in exchange for safe harbor. Envision what they ask of you. If you do it, or [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to see it done, resolve this move as a strong hit.
  * You find no relief, and the situation grows worse. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Heal

**When you receive medical care or provide treatment**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

  * Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
  * Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
  * Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
  * Provide care: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2) or [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) (-2).

On a **miss**, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Hearten

**When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you [Sojourn](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Sojourn), take +1 more.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1).

On a **miss**, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Resupply

**When you attempt to bolster your readiness**, envision the opportunity and your approach. If you...

  * Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
  * Threaten or seize: Roll +iron
  * Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
  * Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take +1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.
  * If you are in need of a specific item or resource that can reasonably be obtained, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle.

On a **miss**, you encounter an unexpected peril. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Repair

**When you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other devices**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

  * Make your own repairs, or direct a companion to make repairs: Roll +wits
  * Obtain repairs from someone (not an ally): Roll +supply

On a **hit**, you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the table below. Additionally, you may [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) and exchange each _1 of supply for 1 extra repair point (up to 3 points).

Situation     | Strong Hit | Weak Hit
--------------|------------|---------
At a facility | 5 points   | 3 points
In the field  | 3 points   | 1 points
Under fire    | 2 points   | 0 points

Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.

  * Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points
  * Fix one broken module: 2 points
  * Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point
  * Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point
  * Repair any other device: 3 points
  * Repair any other device, but with a complication or malfunction: 2 points

On a **miss**, the repairs are not made and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

## Threshold Moves

Despite your best efforts to overcome the perils of the Forge, calamitous events may bring you to the precipice of life and death, redemption and desolation, perseverance and destruction.

In these moments you face your greatest tests. What will become of you when all seems lost? Will you see your character undone, or find yourself on a path of renewed purpose? Make these **threshold moves** to find out.

### Face Death

**When you encounter a situation where death is an immediate and unavoidable outcome**, you are dead. **When you are instead brought to the brink of death with a chance for recovery or redemption**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you are cast back into the mortal world.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * You die, but not before making a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
  * There is more to be done. Envision what is revealed or asked of you at death's door, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to complete an extreme quest. You return to the mortal world and must mark **doomed**. When you complete the deathbound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss**, you are dead.

### Face Desolation

**When you are brought to the brink of desolation**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you resist and press on.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Your spirit breaks, but not before you make a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
  * You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision that dark future, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to prevent it through an extreme quest. You return to your senses and must mark **tormented**. When you complete the soul-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss**, you succumb to despair or horror and are lost.

### Overcome Destruction

*Progress Move*

**When your command vehicle is destroyed or irrevocably lost**, you must discard the asset, along with any modules and docked support vehicles.

If you survive, you may use your connections to replace some of what was lost. To learn the cost, roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress on your bonds legacy track.

On a **strong hit**, you may call in a favor. This comes without conditions.

On a **weak hit**, you owe someone. You must mark **indebted** and [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to complete an extreme quest in their service. When you complete the duty-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss**, as with the weak hit result, but this quest is against your nature, forces you to [Forsake Your Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Forsake_Your_Vow) on another quest, or is in the service of an enemy.

If you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every marked ability on the discarded assets (minimum 3 experience). Spend this experience only on a new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles.

## Legacy Moves

The three **legacy tracks**—quests, bonds, and discoveries—are a special type of progress track to show the evolution of your character. As you fulfill vows, build relationships, and explore the Forge, you'll mark progress on these tracks and gain experience. This experience is then spent on character assets to represent your character's growing skills, influence, and resources.
Make these **legacy moves** to gain and spend experience, and when you face a final test to learn how your accomplishments and failures will echo through time.

### Earn Experience

**When you fill a box (four ticks) on any legacy track**, take 2 experience. This experience may be spent when you [Advance](Starforged/Moves/Legacy/Advance).

Once you completely fill the tenth box on any legacy track, clear that track. You may start again marking progress on the cleared track, but earn experience at a reduced rate of 1 experience (instead of 2) for each filled progress box. If you make a progress roll against this track, resolve the outcome as if at 10 progress.

### Advance

**When you develop your abilities, improve your resources, gain a reward, or boost your influence**, you may spend 3 experience to add a new asset, or 2 experience to upgrade an asset. Choose from the following categories as appropriate to your focus and opportunities.

  * Module: Upgrade your command vehicle
  * Support Vehicle: Acquire or improve a secondary vehicle
  * Path: Bolster your personal capabilities or follow a new calling
  * Companion: Gain or improve a trusted helper
  * Deed: Learn from your experiences or build a legacy

### Continue a Legacy

*Progress Move*

**When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, or succumb to death or desolation**, you may create a new character in your established setting. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare to each of the former character's legacy tracks: quests, bonds, and discoveries (one roll per track).

For each **strong hit**, choose one from below, or one from the weak hit or miss options.

  * Follow their path: Take one path or companion asset from the former character (at no cost), including any marked abilities.
  * Share a connection: Take one connection from the former character, including any accrued progress or bond benefits.
  * Accept an inheritance: Take the former character's command vehicle and one module or support vehicle (at no cost), including any marked abilities.

For each **weak hit**, choose one from below, or one from the miss options.

  * See it through: Choose one of the former character's unfinished quests, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Starforged/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) (with an automatic strong hit) to see it done. You may immediately mark up to half their earned progress (round down) on this quest.
  * Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character's connections, and envision how time or circumstances have changed them in a dramatic way. When you [Make a Connection](Starforged/Moves/Connection/Make_a_Connection) with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark two ticks on your bonds legacy track.
  * Explore familiar ground: Name a location that was meaningful to the former character. When you first visit that place, envision how it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

For each **miss**, choose one.

  * Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former character's foes has gained power or influence.
  * Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your former character's beliefs, goals, or allegiances.
  * Open Pandora's Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.

## Fate Moves

In solo and co-op play, the **fate moves** mediate the result of other moves or serve as inspirational prompts for your story. When you face the uncertain outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question about people, places, and events, these moves help reveal the answer.

### Ask the Oracle

**When you seek to resolve questions, reveal details, discover locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events**, you may...

  * Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.
  * Spark an idea: Use an oracle table or other random prompt.
  * Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the table below to check the answer.
  * Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as likely, and roll on the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.

Odds           | The answer is yes if you roll...
---------------|---------------------------------
Small Chance   | 10 or less
Unlikely       | 25 or less
50/50          | 50 or less
Likely         | 75 or less
Almost Certain | 90 or less

On a match, envision an extreme result or twist.

### Pay the Price

**When you suffer the outcome of an action**, choose one.

  * Make the most obvious negative outcome happen.
  * [Ask the Oracle](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) for inspiration. Interpret the answer as a hardship or complication appropriate to the situation.
  * Roll on the table below. If the result doesn’t fit the situation, roll again.

Roll   | Result

51-56  | A friend, companion, or ally is in harm's way (or you are, if alone)
57-62  | Your equipment or vehicle malfunctions
63-68  | Your vehicle suffers damage
69-74  | You waste resources
75-81  | You are harmed
82-88  | You are stressed
89-95  | You are delayed or put at a disadvantage
96-100 | Roll twice

## Scene Challenge Moves

A **scene challenge** is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency.

Examples of a scene challenge include disarming a timed explosive, hacking a system while evading digital countermeasures, participating in a formal debate before a council, or competing in a hoverbike race.

### Begin the Scene

**When you face an extended or complex challenge outside of a fight**, name your objective and set its rank as formidable.

Then, envision the situation and choose the number of segments for the scene’s tension clock.

  * You are severely disadvantaged: Four segments
  * You are on equal footing: Six segments
  * You have strong advantage: Eight segments

When the clock is full, you must [Finish the Scene](Starforged/Moves/Scene_Challenge/Finish_the_Scene).

### Face Danger (Scene Challenge)

**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat within a scene challenge**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful and mark progress. On a **strong hit with a match**, mark progress twice.

On a **weak hit**, you are successful and mark progress, but also encounter a complication or setback. Envision what occurs and fill a clock segment.

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dramatic turn of events. Fill a clock segment and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). On a **miss with a match**, fill two segments and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Secure an Advantage (Scene Challenge)

**When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage within a scene challenge**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, take both. On a **strong hit with a match**, take both and mark mark progress. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Take +2 momentum
  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. Fill a clock segment and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). On a **miss with a match**, fill two segments and [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

### Finish the Scene

**When the scene challenge tension clock or progress track is filled, or when events lead to the scene’s conclusion**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you achieve your objective unconditionally.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without cost. You must [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). Make this a minor cost relative to the scope of the scene.

On a **miss**, you fail or are undermined by a dire and costly turn of events. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
